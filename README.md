This was my first attempt at implementing Redux in an app that I already made (https://github.com/LucasPennice/ReactWeatherApp), I make use of Redux-Thunk to fetch the API's data and I made my very best attempt at refactoring every single line of code. I also implemented a feature that shows the current day's average, minimum and maximum temperature. I later added that the mobile keyboard hides when you submit the search.
